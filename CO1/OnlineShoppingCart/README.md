 1. Objective:

To develop a Python-based online shopping cart system that allows users to add and remove products, change product quantities, apply discounts, and calculate the final bill including GST.

 2. Algorithm:

1. Start.
2. Create an empty shopping cart and initialize the discount to zero.
3. Display the shopping cart menu.
4. Read the user's choice.
5. If the choice is *1 (Add Product)*:

   * Read the product name, price, and quantity.
   * Add the product details to the cart.
6. If the choice is *2 (Remove Product)*:

   * Read the product name.
   * Search for the product in the cart.
   * If found, remove it.
   * Otherwise, display "Product not found."
7. If the choice is *3 (Change Quantity)*:

   * Read the product name and new quantity.
   * Search for the product in the cart.
   * If found, update its quantity.
   * Otherwise, display "Product not found."
8. If the choice is *4 (Apply Discount)*:

   * Read the discount percentage.
   * Store the discount value.
9. If the choice is *5 (Display Bill)*:

   * Initialize the subtotal to zero.
   * Traverse all products in the cart.
   * Calculate the total price for each product.
   * Add each product total to the subtotal.
   * Calculate the discount amount.
   * Calculate the amount after discount.
   * Calculate 18% GST.
   * Calculate and display the final bill.
10. If the choice is *6 (Exit)*:

    * Display the thank-you message.
    * Terminate the program.
11. For any other choice, display "Invalid choice."
12. Repeat the menu until the user chooses Exit.
13. Stop.

 3. Input:

The program accepts the following inputs:

* User's menu choice
* Product name
* Product price
* Product quantity
* Discount percentage

 4. Output:

The program displays:

* Product added or removed from the cart
* Updated product quantity
* Applied discount
* Product-wise bill details
* Subtotal
* Discount amount
* Amount after discount
* GST at 18%
* Final bill amount
* Appropriate messages for invalid choices or unavailable products

5. Time Complexity:

*O(n)*

Where n is the number of products in the shopping cart.

* *Add Product:* O(1)
* *Remove Product:* O(n)
* *Change Quantity:* O(n)
* *Apply Discount:* O(1)
* *Display Bill:* O(n)
* *Exit:* O(1)

The overall time complexity for a single menu operation is *O(n)* in the worst case because removing, changing quantity, and displaying the bill may require traversing the cart.

 6. Space Complexity:

*O(n)*

The cart stores the details of n products.
